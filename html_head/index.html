        <p>My name is Bret, I am 32 years old, a father of three and happily married. I like to spend my free time playing games, watching movies or doing fun things with my family/friends. I decided to come to atlas so that I could use what I learn here to develop video games. I really enjoy game development and hope that all the coding/tech skills aquired from this school will help me in the long run. Overall I chose full stack development for its broad range of demand in the work field and for its simplicity in comparison to the other tracks here at Atlas.</p>
