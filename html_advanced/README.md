Welcome to my README!!

In this project (HTML Advanced) we are working with HTML to implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file. By using a designer file from figma, we will focus purely on the HTML semantics of the page, nothing more. This will help us to understand:

* What is HTML
* How to create an HTML page from a wireframe
* What is a markup language
* What is the DOM
* What is an element / tag
* What is an attribute
* What the purpose of each HTML tag

At the end of this project we will have created a beautiful webpage for smile school that has full functionality and creative designs. We will also continue to use this wireframe for future projects to help us further understand basic web design principles.
