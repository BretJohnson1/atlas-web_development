Welcome to the CSS Advanced Project! This project is designed to help beginners understand the core concepts of CSS and how to apply them to HTML to create visually appealing web pages. Through a series of explanations and practical exercises, we'll gain hands-on experience with CSS.

**Concepts Covered**

WHAT IS CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS defines how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, or in other media.

HOW TO ADD STYLE TO AN ELEMENT?
You can add style to an HTML element in three ways:

Inline CSS: Directly within the HTML element using the style attribute.
HTML

<p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>


Internal CSS: Within a <style> tag in the HTML documentâ€™s <head>.
HTML

<style>
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

External CSS: In an external stylesheet linked to the HTML document.
HTML

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/main.css">

WHAT IS A CLASS?
A class is a reusable style definition that can be applied to multiple HTML elements. Classes are defined in CSS using a period (.) followed by the class name.

CSS

.blue-text {
  color: blue;
}

HTML

<p class="blue-text">This is a blue paragraph.</p>

WHAT IS A SELECTOR?
A selector is a pattern used to select the elements you want to style. Common selectors include:

Element Selector: Selects all elements of a given type.
CSS

p {
  color: blue;
}

Class Selector: Selects all elements with a specific class.
CSS

.blue-text {
  color: blue;
}

ID Selector: Selects a single element with a specific ID.
CSS

#unique-element {
  color: blue;
}

HOW TO COMPUTE CSS SPECIFICITY VALUE?
CSS specificity determines which styles are applied to an element when multiple rules match. Specificity is calculated based on the types of selectors used:

Inline styles have the highest specificity.
ID selectors have higher specificity than class selectors.
Class selectors have higher specificity than element selectors.

WHAT ARE BOX PROPERTIES IN CSS?
The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree and includes the following properties:

Content: The actual content of the element.
Padding: Space between the content and the border.
Border: The border surrounding the padding (if any).
Margin: Space outside the border.

HOW DOES THE BROWSER LOAD A WEBPAGE?
When you load a webpage, the browser performs the following steps:

DNS Lookup: Resolves the domain name to an IP address.
HTTP Request: Sends a request to the server for the webpage.
Response: The server sends back the HTML document.
Parsing: The browser parses the HTML and constructs the DOM (Document Object Model).
CSSOM Construction: The browser parses CSS and constructs the CSSOM (CSS Object Model).
Rendering: The browser combines the DOM and CSSOM to render the webpage.
